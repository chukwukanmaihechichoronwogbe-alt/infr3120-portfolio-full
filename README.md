Student Info

Name: Nwogbe Chukwukanma

Course: INFR3120 – Web and Scripting Programming

Assignment: Portfolio Website

1. Overview

This is my personal portfolio website created with HTML5 and CSS3. It shows my basic information, projects, and a way to contact me. The goal was to practice semantic HTML, responsive design, and making sure the site works well across different screen sizes.

The site has four main pages:

Home (index.html)

About Me (about.html)

Projects (projects.html)

Contact (contact.html)

2. Responsive Design

I used three main breakpoints for responsiveness:

Mobile: up to 599px

Tablet: 600px – 1023px

Desktop: 1024px and above

I chose these sizes because they cover the most common devices like phones, tablets, and laptops/desktops.

3. Layout

The website uses percentage widths and media queries to adjust the layout. I did not use Flexbox or Grid since the assignment does not allow it.

4. Color Scheme

Main color: Blue (#0066cc)

Secondary color: Light Gray (#eeeeee)

I chose blue because it feels professional and readable, and the light gray helps balance the background. I tested the colors using Adobe Color to make sure they work well together.

5. Linear Gradient

I applied gradients in two places: the header background and the contact form submit button.. This makes the button stand out and gives it a modern look.

Example:

background: linear-gradient(to right, #0066cc, #00ccff);

6. Validation and Testing

HTML validated with W3C HTML Validator

CSS validated with W3C CSS Validator

Links checked with W3C Link Checker

Accessibility checked with WAVE

After fixing a couple of missing alt attributes, all files passed validation with no major issues.

7. Version Control

The code is on a public GitHub repository. The site is also hosted live using GitHub Pages.

8. External Code

No outside code was used, except for examples from class. All other code was written by me.
